" Mapping to move lines
" NOTE: THESE MAPPINGS NEED TO BE CONFIGURED MANUALLY IN XCODE KEY BINDINGS
" The command :m .+1 (which can be abbreviated to :m+)
" moves the current line to after line number .+1 (current line number + 1).
" That is, the current line is moved down one line.
" The command :m .-2 (which can be abbreviated to :m-2)

" moves the current line to after line number .-2 (current line number − 2).
" That is, the current line is moved up one line.

" After visually selecting some lines, entering :m '>+1
" moves the selected lines to after line number '>+1 (one line after the last selected line;
" '> is a mark assigned by Vim to identify the selection end).
" That is, the block of selected lines is moved down one line.

" The == re-indents the line to suit its new position.
" For the visual-mode mappings, gv reselects the last visual block and = re-indents that block.
